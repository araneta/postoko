mplementation Complete
1. Order Creation Integration (/store/useStore.ts)
typescript
// Record inventory movements for each cart item
for (const cartItem of cart) {
  await get().recordInventoryMovement({
    productId: cartItem.id,
    type: 'sale',
    quantity: -cartItem.quantity, // Negative for sales
    referenceId: order.id,
  });
}
When orders are created:

Automatically records inventory movements for all cart items
Uses 'sale' type with negative quantities
Links to order ID for tracking
Updates local product stock levels
2. Manual Stock Adjustments (/app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx)
typescript
await adjustInventoryStock(adjustment);
When stock is manually adjusted:

Uses the store's adjustInventoryStock function
Records adjustment movement automatically
Updates local state and refreshes data
🔄 How It Works
Sales Flow:
Customer purchases items → Cart populated
Order created → createOrder() called
Inventory movement recorded → recordInventoryMovement() with type: 'sale'
Stock updated → Local product stock decreased
Backend updated → API call records movement
Data refreshed → Low stock alerts checked
Manual Adjustments Flow:
User opens inventory screen → Low stock products shown
Clicks adjust button → Modal opens
Enters new stock amount → Form validated
Submits adjustment → adjustInventoryStock() called
Movement recorded → Backend tracks change
UI updated → Stock levels refreshed
🎯 Key Features
Automatic Tracking: All sales automatically recorded
Manual Adjustments: Stock corrections with reasons
Real-time Updates: Local state syncs with backend
Error Handling: Graceful failure management
Audit Trail: Complete movement history
Low Stock Alerts: Automatic notifications
The implementation is now fully functional and will track all inventory movements automatically when orders are placed or when manual adjustments are made!
