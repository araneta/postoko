Perfect! I've successfully added support for Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO) offers and time-based promotions (happy hour) to your promotions system. Here's what I've implemented:

New Promotion Types Added:
1. Buy X Get Y (BOGO) Promotions
Buy 2 Get 1 Free: Customer gets the 3rd item completely free
Buy 1 Get 1 Half Off: Second item gets 50% discount
Buy 3 Get 2 Fixed Price: Get items at a fixed discounted price
Configurable buy/get quantities and discount types (free, percentage, fixed amount)
2. Time-Based Promotions
Daily Happy Hour: Active every day during specific hours (e.g., 5-7 PM)
Weekly Specials: Active on specific days of the week (e.g., weekends)
Holiday/Special Dates: Active only on specific calendar dates
Configurable time ranges and date patterns
Key Features:
Database Schema Updates:
Added BOGO fields: buyQuantity, getQuantity, getDiscountType, getDiscountValue
Added time-based fields: timeBasedType, activeDays, activeTimeStart, activeTimeEnd, specificDates
Smart Discount Calculation:
BOGO Logic: Automatically calculates free/discounted items based on purchase quantities
Time Validation: Checks current time against promotion schedules
Flexible Configuration: Supports multiple discount types within BOGO offers
Enhanced Dashboard:
Dynamic form fields that show/hide based on promotion type
Time picker for happy hour settings
Day selector for weekly promotions
Date input for specific holiday promotions
API Endpoints:
All existing endpoints work with new promotion types
Enhanced validation for BOGO and time-based specific fields
Comprehensive error handling and validation
Usage Examples:
Happy Hour (5-7 PM daily, 15% off):

{
  "type": "time_based",
  "discountValue": 15,
  "timeBasedType": "daily",
  "activeTimeStart": "17:00:00",
  "activeTimeEnd": "19:00:00"
}
Weekend Special (Sat-Sun, 25% off):

{
  "type": "time_based",
  "discountValue": 25,
  "timeBasedType": "weekly",
  "activeDays": [0, 6],
  "activeTimeStart": "10:00:00",
  "activeTimeEnd": "22:00:00"
}
Buy 2 Get 1 Free:

{
  "type": "buy_x_get_y",
  "buyQuantity": 2,
  "getQuantity": 1,
  "getDiscountType": "free"
}
The system now supports all four major promotion types: percentage discounts, fixed amount discounts, BOGO offers, and time-based promotions. The promotions can be combined with product/category restrictions, usage limits, and discount codes for maximum flexibility.
