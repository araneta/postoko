What “Supplier Information Tracking” actually means (in POS terms)

At its core, it answers one simple question for the merchant:

“Where did I buy this product from, and who do I contact to restock it?”

That’s it.
Not ERP. Not SAP. Not accounting hell.

Minimum Useful Version (MVP) ✅ — What you SHOULD build
1. Supplier Master Data (simple)

One table / entity:

Supplier
- id
- name
- phone
- email (optional)
- address (optional)
- notes (optional)
- isActive


👉 This alone already unlocks value.

2. Link Supplier → Product (1-to-many)

Each product can have ONE primary supplier.

Product
- id
- name
- sku
- supplierId   ← THIS is the key


Why this matters:

Low stock alert → “Order from Supplier X”

Inventory view → grouped by supplier

Faster reordering

3. Show supplier info in 3 places only

As PM, I would restrict it to:

Product detail page

Supplier: PT Sumber Jaya

Low stock alert

“Product A low — Supplier: PT Sumber Jaya (0812…)”

Product import (CSV)

supplier_name column (auto-create if not exists)

🚫 No purchase orders yet
🚫 No invoices
🚫 No payments

What NOT to build (yet) ❌

These are ERP features, not POS MVP:

Supplier invoices

Accounts payable

Payment terms

Partial deliveries

Multi-supplier per product

Purchase order approval flow

If you build these too early → project explodes.

When Supplier Tracking becomes REALLY useful

Later (Phase 5+), supplier data enables:

Feature	Uses supplier data
Purchase Orders	Supplier is mandatory
Restock suggestion	Group by supplier
Cost tracking	Compare supplier prices
Lead time analysis	Slow suppliers

But none of these are required now.

PM Decision Framework (use this)

Ask this question before adding anything:

“Can the cashier sell faster?”
❌ No → not Phase 1–3

“Can the owner restock smarter?”
✅ Yes → keep it

Supplier info passes the second test, not the first.

Recommended Scope for YOUR project (clear answer)

Given your current roadmap, I recommend:

✅ Build now

Supplier CRUD

Product → Supplier link

Show supplier on low-stock alert

CSV import support

⏳ Build later

Purchase orders

Supplier price history

Supplier performance metrics
